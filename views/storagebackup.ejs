    <h4 class="heading_style">SAN Storage Solution</h4>

    <p class="general_paragraph">
      A Storage Area Network (SAN) is a high-speed Special network that provides multiple servers access to consolidated pools of shared, block-level storage. SANs are typically composed of hosts, switches, storage elements, and storage devices that are interconnected using a variety of technologies, topologies, and protocols.
    
    SANs deliver highly reliable, highly scalable block-level storage solutions, accessible by many hosts. Increased storage utilization rates often drive down storage cost of ownership, while multiple security and reliability features ensure mission critical data, is always protected and available. These enterprise-class features make SANs the storage solution of choice for today’s data-driven organizations
    
    Mas Infosys Provides SAN Storage Solution based on different Vendor like DELL EMC, HPE, and NETAPP and based on Customer Request and Application

    <p class="general_paragraph">
      Network-attached storage (NAS) is a file-level storage architecture where 1 or more servers with dedicated disks store data and share it with many clients connected to a network.
      Network-attached storage (NAS) is dedicated file storage that enables multiple users and heterogeneous client devices to retrieve data from centralized disk capacity. Users on a local area network (LAN) access the shared storage via a standard Ethernet connection.

  <h4 class="heading_style">Object Storage Solution</h4>

  <p class="general_paragraph">
    Object storage (also known as object-based storage) is a computer data storage architecture that manages data as objects, as opposed to other storage architectures like file systems which manages data as a file hierarchy, and block storage which manages data as blocks within sectors and tracks.

Object storage is ideal for hosting static websites. Easily deploy a site and manage content without maintaining your own infrastructure. Object storage is the best choice for data that doesn’t change often. Store backup files, database dumps, logs, and massive data sets. All accessible over the Internet via a URL.

  <h4 class="heading_style">software defined storage</h4>

  <p class="general_paragraph">
    Software-defined storage (SDS) is a marketing term for computer data storage software for policy-based provisioning and management of data storage independent of the underlying hardware.

Software-defined storage (SDS) is an intelligent virtualization software layer that manages and unifies every storage-area network (SAN) or network-attached storage (NAS) device inside your data center, while providing enterprise-level functionality with zero dependence on proprietary hardware.

  <h4 class="heading_style">Disk Based Backup Solution</h4>

  <p class="general_paragraph">
    Backup-to-disk refers to technology that allows one to back up large amounts of data to a disk storage unit. The backup-to-disk technology is often supplemented by tape drives for data archival or replication to another facility for disaster recovery

Disk-based backup offers faster backups and restores than tape, while eliminating many of the headaches that come with the storage and transport of tape media. When you combine the cost per gigabyte of disk and the advantages of data de-duplication, disk-based backup becomes a compelling proposition for storage administrators. Furthermore, in a storage architecture, disk-based backups can form a near-line tier which matches data by age and usefulness to the cost of media.

  <h4 class="heading_style">Cloud Based Backup Solution </h4>

  <p class="lead">
    Cloud backup (also known as online backup) is a type of data backup whereby a copy of the data is sent over a secure proprietary or public network to a cloud-based server. … The data is then available from various access points and can be shared among multiple cloud users.

 

To keep data secure, the front line of defense for any cloud system is encryption. … Yes, the only way to keep your data safe for certain is to lock it up in a safe beneath the ground. That being said, your cloud-stored data is generally safer than your locally stored data.
